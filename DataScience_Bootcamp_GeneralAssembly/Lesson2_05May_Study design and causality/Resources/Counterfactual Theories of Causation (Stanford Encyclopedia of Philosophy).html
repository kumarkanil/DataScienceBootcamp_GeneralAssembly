<h1>Counterfactual Theories of Causation</h1><div id="pubinfo"><em>First published Wed Jan 10, 2001; substantive revision Mon Feb 10, 2014</em></div>

<div id="preamble">

<p>

The basic idea of counterfactual theories of causation is that the
meaning of causal claims can be explained in terms of counterfactual
conditionals of the form “If <em>A</em> had not
occurred, <em>C</em> would not have occurred”. While
counterfactual analyses have been given of type-causal concepts, most
counterfactual analyses have focused on singular causal or
token-causal claims of the form “event <em>c</em> caused
event <em>e</em>”. Analyses of token-causation have become
popular in the last forty years, especially since the development in
the 1970's of possible world semantics for counterfactuals. The best
known counterfactual analysis of causation is David Lewis's (1973b)
theory. However, intense discussion over forty years has cast doubt on
the adequacy of any simple analysis of singular causation in terms of
counterfactuals. Recent years have seen a proliferation of different
refinements of the basic idea to achieve a closer match with
commonsense judgements about causation.

<h2><a name="EarCouThe">1. Early Counterfactual Theories</a></h2>

<p>

The first explicit definition of causation in terms of
counterfactuals was, surprisingly enough, given by Hume, when he
wrote: “We may define a cause to be <i>an object followed by another,
and where all the objects, similar to the first, are followed by
objects similar to the second</i>. Or, in other words, <i>where, if
the first object had not been, the second never had existed</i>.”
(1748, Section VII). It is difficult to understand how Hume could
have confused the first, regularity definition with the second, very
different counterfactual definition.</p>

<p>
 At any rate, Hume never explored the alternative counterfactual
approach to causation. In this, as in much else, he was followed by
generations of empiricist philosophers. The chief obstacle in
empiricists' minds to explaining causation in terms of
counterfactuals was the obscurity of counterfactuals themselves,
owing chiefly to their reference to unactualised
possibilities. Starting with J. S. Mill (1843), empiricists tried to
analyse counterfactuals ‘metalinguistically’ in terms of
implication relations between statements. The rough idea is that a
counterfactual of the form “If it had been the case that A, it would
have been the case that <em>C</em>” is true if and only if there is an
auxiliary set <em>S</em> of true statements consistent with the
antecedent <em>A</em>, such that the members of <em>S</em>, when
conjoined with <em>A</em>, imply the consequent <em>C</em>. Much
debate centred around the issue of the precise specification of the
set <em>S</em>. (See N. Goodman 1947.) Most empiricists agreed that
<em>S</em> would have to include statements of laws of nature, while
some thought that it would have to include statements of singular
causation. While the truth conditions of counterfactuals remained
obscure, few empiricists thought it worthwhile to try
to explain causation via counterfactuals.</p>

<p>
 Indeed, the first real attempts to present rigorous counterfactual
analyses of causation came only in the late 1960's. (See A. Lyon
1967.) Typical of these attempts was J. L. Mackie's counterfactual
analysis in Chapter 2 of his seminal book <i>The Cement of the
Universe</i> (1974). As well as offering a sophisticated regularity
theory of causation ‘in the objects’, Mackie presented a
counterfactual account of the concept of a cause as “what makes the
difference in relation to some background or causal field” (1980,
p.xi). Mackie's account of the concept of causation is rich in
insights, especially concerning its relativity to a field of
background conditions. However, his account never gained as much
attention as his regularity theory of causation ‘in the
objects’, no doubt because his view of counterfactuals (in his
(1973)), as condensed arguments that do not have truth values,
compounded empiricists' scepticism about counterfactuals.</p>

<p>
 The true potential of the counterfactual approach to causation did
not become clear until counterfactuals became better understood
through the development of possible world semantics in the early
1970's.</p>

<h2><a name="Lew197CouAna">2. Lewis's 1973 Counterfactual Analysis</a></h2>

<p>

The best known and most thoroughly elaborated counterfactual theory of
causation is David Lewis's theory in his (1973b), which was refined
and extended in articles subsequently collected in his (1986a). In
response to doubts about the theory's treatment of preemption, Lewis
subsequently proposed a fairly radical revision of the theory. (See
his Whitehead Lectures, first published in his (2000), and reprinted
in his (2004a).) In this section we shall confine our attention to the
original 1973 theory, deferring the later changes he proposed for
consideration below.</p>

<ul>
 <li>2.1 Counterfactuals and Causal Dependence</li>
 <li>2.2 The Asymmetry of Causal Dependence</li>
 <li>2.3 Preemption and Transitivity</li>
 <li>2.4 Chancy Causation</li>
 <li>2.5 The Theory's Advantages</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="CouCauDep">2.1 Counterfactuals and Causal Dependence</a></h3>

<p>

Like most contemporary counterfactual theories, Lewis's theory employs
a possible world semantics for counterfactuals. Such a semantics
states truth conditions for counterfactuals in terms of similarity
relations between possible worlds. Lewis famously espouses a realism
about possible worlds, according to which non-actual possible worlds
are real concrete entities on a par with the actual world. (See
Lewis's defence of modal realism in his (1986e).) However, most
contemporary philosophers would seek to deploy the explanatorily
fruitful possible worlds framework while distancing themselves from
full-blown realism about possible worlds themselves. For example, many
would propose to understand possible worlds as maximally consistent
sets of propositions; or even to treat them instrumentally as useful
theoretical entities having no independent reality.</p>

<p>
 The central notion of a possible world semantics for counterfactuals
is a relation of <i>comparative similarity</i> between worlds (Lewis
1973a). One world is said to be <i>closer to actuality</i> than
another if the first resembles the actual world more than the second
does. Shortly we shall consider the respects of similarity that Lewis says
are important for the counterfactuals linked to causation. For now we
simply note two formal constraints he imposes on this similarity
relation. First, the relation of similarity produces a weak ordering
of worlds so that any two worlds can be ordered with respect to their
closeness to the actual world, with allowance being made for ties in
closeness. Secondly, the actual world is closest to actuality,
resembling itself more than any other world resembles it.</p>

<p>
 In terms of this similarity relation, the truth condition for the
counterfactual “If <em>A</em> were (or had been) the case, <em>C</em>
would be (or have been) the case” is stated as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top">(1)</td>
<td>“If <em>A</em> were the case, <em>C</em> would be the
case” is <i>true</i> in the actual world if and only if (i)
there are no possible <em>A</em>-worlds; or (ii) some <em>A</em>-world
where <em>C</em> holds is closer to the actual world than is
any <em>A</em>-world where <em>C</em> does not hold.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 We shall ignore the first case in which the counterfactual is
vacuously true. The fundamental idea of this analysis is that the
counterfactual “If <em>A</em> were the case, <em>C</em> would be the
case” is true just in case it takes less of a departure from actuality
to make the antecedent true along with the consequent than to make the
antecedent true without the consequent.</p>

<p>
 In terms of counterfactuals, Lewis defines a notion of causal
dependence between events, which plays a central role in his theory of causation 
(1973b).</p>

<blockquote>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top">(2)</td>
<td>Where <em>c</em> and <em>e</em> are two distinct possible
events, <em>e</em> <i>causally depends</i> on <em>c</em> if and only if, if
<em>c</em> were to occur  <em>e</em> would occur; and if <em>c</em> were not to
occur <em>e</em> would not occur.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

This condition states that whether <em>e</em> occurs or not depends on
whether <em>c</em> occurs or not. Where <em>c</em> and <em>e</em> are
actual occurrent events, this truth condition can be simplified
somewhat. For in this case it follows from the second formal condition
on the comparative similarity relation that the counterfactual “If
<em>c</em> were to occur <em>e</em> would occur” is automatically
true: this formal condition implies that a counterfactual with true
antecedent and true consequent is itself true. Consequently, the truth
condition for causal dependence becomes:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top">(3)</td>
<td>Where <em>c</em> and <em>e</em> are two distinct <i>actual</i> events,
<em>e</em> <i>causally depends</i> on <em>c</em> if and only if, if <em>c</em>
were not to occur <em>e</em> would not occur.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

 The right hand side of this condition is, of course, Hume's second
definition of causation. (As we shall see shortly, Lewis's official
definition of causation differs from it, as he defines causation not
in terms of causal dependence directly, but in terms of chains of
causal dependence.) Why is it plausible to think that causation is
conceptually linked with counterfactuals in the way specified by this
definition of causal dependence? One reason is that the idea of a
cause is conceptually linked with the idea of something that makes a
difference and this idea in turn is best understood in terms of
counterfactuals. In Lewis's words: “We think of a cause as something
that makes a difference, and the difference it makes must be a
difference from what would have happened without it. Had it been
absent, its effects — some of them, at least, and usually all
— would have been absent as well.” (1973b, p.161)</p>

<p>

There are three important things to note about the definition of
causal dependence. First, it takes the primary relata of causal
dependence to be <i>events</i>. Lewis's own theory of events
(1986b) construes events as classes of possible spatiotemporal
regions. However, very different conceptions of events are compatible
with the basic definition. Indeed, it even seems possible to
formulate it in terms of facts rather than events. (For instance, see
Mellor 1996, 2004.)</p> 

<p>

Secondly, the definition requires the causally dependent events to be
<i>distinct</i> from each other. Distinctness means that the events
are not identical, neither is part of the other, and neither implies the
other. This qualification is important if spurious non-causal
dependences are to be ruled out. (For this point see Kim 1973 and
Lewis 1986b.) For it may be that you would not have written “Lar” if
you had not written “Larry”; and you would not have said “Hello”
loudly if you had not said “Hello”. But neither dependence counts as a
causal dependence since the paired events are not distinct from each
other in the required sense.</p>

<p>

Thirdly, the counterfactuals that are employed in the analysis are to
be understood according to what Lewis calls the standard
interpretation. There are several possible ways of interpreting
counterfactuals; and some interpretations give rise to spurious
non-causal dependences between events. For example, suppose that the
events <em>c</em> and <em>e</em> are effects of a common cause
<em>d</em>. It is tempting to reason that there must be a causal
dependence between <em>c</em> and <em>e</em> by engaging in the
following piece of counterfactual reasoning: if <em>c</em> had not
occurred, then it would have to have been the case that <em>d</em> did
not occur, in which case <em>e</em> would not have occurred. But Lewis
says these counterfactuals, which he calls <i>backtracking</i>
counterfactuals, are not to be used in the assessment of causal
dependence. The right counterfactuals to be used are
<i>non-backtracking counterfactuals</i> that typically hold the past
fixed up until the time at which the counterfactual antecedent is
supposed to obtain.</p>

<h3><a name="TemAsyCauDep">2.2 The Temporal Asymmetry of Causal Dependence</a></h3>

<p>

What constitutes the direction of the causal relation? Why is this
direction typically aligned with the temporal direction from past to
future? In answer to these questions, Lewis (1979) argues that the
direction of causation is the direction of causal dependence; and it
is typically true that events causally depend on earlier events but
not on later events. He emphasises the contingency of the latter fact
because he regards backwards or time-reversed causation as a
conceptual possibility that cannot be ruled out <i>a
priori</i>. Accordingly, he dismisses any analysis of counterfactuals
that would deliver the temporal asymmetry by conceptual fiat.</p>

<p>
 Lewis's explanation of the temporal asymmetry of counterfactual
dependence is based on a <i>de facto</i> asymmetry about the actual
world. He defines a <i>determinant</i> for an event as any set of
conditions jointly sufficient, given the laws of nature, for the
event's occurrence. (Determinants of an event may be causes or traces
of the event.) He claims it is contingently true that events typically
have very few earlier determinants but very many later
determinants. As an illustration, he cites Popper's (1956) example of
a spherical wavefront expanding outwards from a point source. This is
a process where each sample of the wave postdetermines what happens at
the point at which the wave is emitted. He says the reverse process in
which a spherical wave contracts inward with each sample of wave
predetermining what happens at the point the wave is absorbed would
obey the laws of nature but seldom happens in actual fact.</p>

<p>
 Lewis combines the <i>de facto</i> asymmetry of overdetermination
with his analysis of the comparative similarity relation
(1979). According to this analysis, there are several respects of
similarity to be taken into account in evaluating non-backtracking
counterfactuals: similarity with respect to laws of nature and also
similarity with respect to particular matters of fact. Worlds are more
similar to the actual world the fewer miracles or violations of the
actual laws of nature they contain. Again, worlds are more similar to
the actual world the greater the spatio-temporal region of perfect
match of particular fact they have with the actual world. If the
actual world is governed by deterministic laws, these rules will clash
in assessing which counterfactual worlds are more similar to the
actual world. For a world that makes a counterfactual antecedent true
must differ from the actual world either in allowing some violation of
the actual laws, or in differing from the actual world in particular
matters of fact. Lewis's analysis allows a tradeoff between these
competing respects of similarity in such cases. It implies that worlds
with an extensive region of perfect match of particular fact can be
considered very similar to the actual world provided that the match in
particular facts with the actual world is achieved at the cost of a
small, local miracle, but not at the cost of a big, diverse
miracle. Taken by itself, this account contains no built-in time
asymmetry. That comes only when it is combined with the asymmetry of
overdetermination.</p>

<p>
 To see how the two parts combine, consider the famous example of
Nixon and the Nuclear Holocaust. An early objection to Lewis's
account of counterfactuals (Fine 1975) was that,
counterintuitively, it makes this counterfactual false:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top">(4)</td>
 <td>If Nixon had pressed the button, there would have been a nuclear
war.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

 The argument is that a world in which Nixon pressed the button, but
some minute violation of the laws then prevented a nuclear war, is
much more like the actual world than one in which Nixon pressed the
button and a nuclear war took place. Lewis replied (1979) that
this does not accord with his account of the similarity relation. On
this account, a button-pressing world that diverges from the actual
world by virtue of a miracle is more like the actual world than a
button-pressing world that converges with the actual world by virtue
of a miracle. For in view of the asymmetry of overdetermination, the
divergence miracle that allows Nixon to press the button need only be
a small, local miracle, but the convergence miracle required to wipe
out the traces of Nixon's pressing the button must be a very
big, diverse miracle. Of course, if the asymmetry of
overdetermination went in the opposite temporal direction, the very
same standards of similarity would dictate the opposite verdict.</p>

<p>
 In general, then, the symmetric analysis of similarity, combined with
the <i>de facto</i> asymmetry of overdetermination, implies that
worlds that accommodate counterfactual changes by preserving the
actual past and allowing for divergence miracles are more similar to
the actual world than worlds that accommodate such changes by allowing
for convergence miracles that preserve the actual future. This fact in
turn implies that, where the asymmetry of overdetermination obtains,
the present counterfactually depends on the past, but not on the
future.</p>

<h3><a name="TraPre">2.3 Transitivity and Preemption</a></h3>

<p>

According to Lewis, causal dependence between actual events is
sufficient for causation, but not necessary (1973b): it is possible to
have causation without causal dependence. This can happen in the
following way. Suppose that <em>c</em> causes <em>d</em> in virtue of
the fact that <em>d</em> causally depends on <em>c</em>, and
<em>d</em> causes <em>e</em> in virtue of the fact that <em>e</em>
causally depends on <em>d</em>. Then because causation is transitive,
Lewis insists, <em>c</em> must cause <em>e</em>. However, because
causal dependence is not transitive like causation, the causal
relation between <em>c</em> and <em>e</em> may not be matched by a
causal dependence. (We shall shortly consider an example of this
kind.)</p>

<p>
 To overcome this problem Lewis extends causal dependence to a
transitive relation by taking its ancestral. He defines a <i>causal
chain</i> as a finite sequence of actual events <em>c</em>,
<em>d</em>, <em>e</em>,… where <em>d</em> causally depends on
<em>c</em>, <em>e</em> on <em>d</em>, and so on throughout the
sequence. Then causation is finally defined in these terms:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top">(5)</td>
<td><em>c</em> is <i>a cause</i> of <em>e</em> if and only if there exists
a causal chain leading from <em>c</em> to <em>e</em>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

 This definition not only ensures the transitivity of causation, but
it also appears to solve an additional problem to do with preemption
that is illustrated by the following example. Suppose that two crack
marksmen conspire to assassinate a hated dictator, agreeing that one
or other will shoot the dictator on a public occasion. Acting
side-by-side, assassins <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> find a good vantage
point, and, when the dictator appears, both take aim. <em>A</em> pulls
his trigger and fires a shot that hits its mark, but <em>B</em>
desists from firing when he sees <em>A</em> pull his trigger. Here
assassin <em>A</em>'s actions are the actual cause of the dictator's
death, while <em>B</em>'s actions are a preempted potential
cause. (Lewis distinguishes such cases of <i>preemption</i> from cases
of <i>symmetrical overdetermination</i> in which two processes
terminate in the effect, with neither process preempting the
other. Lewis believes that these cases are not suitable test cases for
a theory of causation since they do not elicit clear judgements.)  The
problem raised by this example of preemption is that both actions are
on a par from the point of view of causal dependence: if neither
<em>A</em> nor <em>B</em> acted, then the dictator would not have
died; and if either had acted without the other, the dictator would
have died.</p>

<p>
 However, given the definition of causation in terms of causal chains,
Lewis is able to distinguish the preempting actual cause from the
preempted potential cause. There is a causal chain running from
<em>A</em>'s actions to the dictator's death, but no such chain
running from <em>B</em>'s actions to the dictator's death. Take, for
example, as an intermediary event occurring between <em>A</em>'s
taking aim and the dictator's death, the bullet from <em>A</em>'s gun
speeding through the air in mid-trajectory. The speeding bullet
causally depends on <em>A</em>'s action since the bullet would not
have been in mid-trajectory without <em>A</em>'s action; and the
dictator's death causally depends on the speeding bullet since by the
time the bullet is in mid-trajectory <em>B</em> has refrained from
firing so that the dictator would not have died without the presence
of the speeding bullet. (Notice that this case illustrates the
failure of transitivity of causal dependence since the dictator's
death does not causally depend on <em>A</em>'s actions.) Hence, we
have a causal chain, and so causation. But no corresponding
intermediary can be found between <em>B</em>'s actions and the
dictator's death; and for this reason <em>B</em>'s actions do not
count as an actual cause of the death.</p>

<h3><a name="ChaCau">2.4 Chancy Causation</a></h3>

<p>

So far we have considered how the counterfactual theory of causation
works under the assumption of determinism. But what about causation
when determinism fails? Lewis (1986c) argues that chancy causation is
a conceptual possibility that must be accommodated by a theory of
causation. Indeed, contemporary physics tells us the actual world
abounds with probabilistic processes that are causal in character. To
take a familiar example (Lewis 1986c): suppose that you mischievously hook
up a bomb to a radioactive source and geiger counter in such a way
that the bomb explodes when the counter registers a certain number of
clicks. If it happens that the counter registers the required number
of clicks and the bomb explodes, your act caused the explosion, even
though there is no deterministic connection between them.</p>

<p>
 In order to accommodate chancy causation, Lewis (1986c) defines a
more general notion of causal dependence in terms of chancy
counterfactuals. These counterfactuals are of the form “If <em>A</em>
were the case <em>Pr</em> (<em>C</em>) would be <em>x</em>”, where the
counterfactual is an ordinary would-counterfactual, interpreted
according to the semantics above, and the <em>Pr</em> operator is a
probability operator with narrow scope confined to the consequent of
the counterfactual. Lewis interprets the probabilities involved as
temporally indexed single-case chances. (See his (1980) for the theory
of single-case chance.)</p>

<p>
 The more general notion of causal dependence reads:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top">(6)</td>
<td>Where <em>c</em> and <em>e</em> are distinct actual events, <em>e</em>
<i>causally depends</i> on <em>c</em> if and only if, if <em>c</em>
were not occurred, the chance of <em>e</em>'s occurring would be much
less than its actual chance.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

This definition covers cases of deterministic causation in which the
chance of the effect with the cause is 1 and the chance of the effect
without the cause is 0. But it also allows for cases of irreducible
probabilistic causation where these chances can take non-extreme
values. It is similar to the central notion of probabilistic relevance
used in probabilistic theories of type-causation, except that it
employs chancy counterfactuals rather than conditional
probabilities. (See the discussion in Lewis 1986c for the advantages
of the counterfactual approach over the probabilistic one. Also see
the entry “Probabilistic Causation”.)</p>

<p>
 The rest of the theory of chancy causation follows the outlines of
the theory of deterministic causation. Causal dependence is extended
to a transitive notion by taking its ancestral. As before, we have
causation when we have one or more steps of causal dependence.</p>

<h3><a name="TheAdv">2.5 The Theory's Advantages</a></h3>

<p>

Before turning to survey some of the problems confronting Lewis's
theory of causation, it is worthwhile pausing to consider some of the
advantages it affords.</p>

<p>

At the time that Lewis advanced his original theory, regularity
theories of causation were the orthodoxy. Taking Hume's first
definition as their point of departure, these theories defined
causation in terms of subsumption under lawful regularities. A typical
formulation went like this: <em>c</em> is a cause of <em>e</em> if and
only <em>c</em> belongs to a minimal set of conditions that are
jointly suficient for <em>e</em>, given the laws. It was well known
that theories of this kind were faced with a number of recalcitrant
counterexamples. Thus, while <em>c</em> might belong to a minimal set
of sufficient conditions for <em>e</em> when <em>c</em> is a genuine
cause of <em>e</em>, this might also be true when <em>c</em> is an
effect of <em>e</em> — an effect which could not have occurred,
given the laws and the actual circumstances, except by being caused by
<em>e</em>. Or it might be true when <em>c</em> and <em>e</em> are
joint effects of a common deterministic cause. Or when <em>c</em> is a
preempted potential cause of <em>e</em> — something that did not
cause <em>e</em>, but would have done so if the actual cause had been
absent.</p>

<p>

In contrast, Lewis's counterfactual analysis of causation is not
subject to the same counterexamples, so long the counterfactuals in
the definition of causal dependence and causation are interpreted in a
non-backtracking fashion. The theory implies that even if <em>c</em>
belongs to a minimal set of sufficient conditions for <em>e</em>,
<em>e</em> will not causally depend on <em>c</em> when <em>c</em>
occurs after <em>e</em> as its effect, since earlier events do not
typically causally depend on later events. Nor will <em>e</em>
causally depend on <em>c</em> when <em>c</em> and <em>e</em> are joint
effects of a common cause, since the non-backtracking counterfactual
“If <em>c</em> had not occurred, <em>e</em> would still have occurred”
will be true in view of the fact that it holds fixed the presence of
the common cause. Nor will <em>c</em> count as a cause of <em>e</em>
when <em>c</em> is a preempted potential cause of <em>e</em> in a
typical case of preemption. For, as we have seen, <em>c</em> will not
be connected to <em>e</em> by a chain of causal dependences.</p>

<p>

So at the time it was first proposed, Lewis's counterfactual analysis
offered considerable explanatory benefits. (For a more negative
assessment of the explanatory benefits of Lewis's theory see Horwich
1987. For extensive discussions of the merits of counterfactual
theories of causation, including Lewis's, see Moore 2009:
Chaps. 16-17; Paul 2009; Paul and Hall 2013 <i>passim</i>).</p>

<h2><a name="ProForLewCouThe">3. Problems for Lewis's Counterfactual Theory</a></h2>

<p>

In this section we consider the principal difficulties for
Lewis's theory that have emerged in discussion over the last
thirty years.</p>

<ul>
<li>3.1 Context-sensitivity</li>
<li>3.2 Temporal Asymmetry</li>
<li>3.3 Transitivity</li>
<li>3.4 Preemption</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="ConSen">3.1 Context-sensitivity</a></h3>

<p>

In recent years a great deal of attention has been paid to the
context-sensitivity of causal statements. (See Hall 2007; Halpern and
Hitchcock, forthcoming; Hitchcock 1996a, 1996b, 2007; Hitchcock and
Knobe 2009; Maslen 2004; Menzies 2004a, 2007, 2009; Northcott 2008;
Schaffer 2005, 2013) In so far as Lewis's theory overlooks this
context-sensitivity, it represents a shortcoming of the theory.</p>

<p>
 The theory assumes that causation is an absolute relation whose
nature does not vary from one context to another. (This follows from
the way the counterfactuals that define the central notion of causal
dependence are governed by a unique, context-invariant system of
weighted respects of similarity.) According to the theory, any event
but for which an effect would not have occurred is one of the effect's
causes. But this generates some absurd results. For example, suppose a
camper lights a fire, a sudden gust of wind fans the fire, the fire
gets out of control and the forest burns down. It is true that if the
camper had not lit the fire, the forest fire would not have
occurred. But it is also true that the forest fire would not have
occurred if any of a vast number of contingencies, including the
camper's birth and his failure to be struck down by a meteor before
striking the match, had not occurred. But commonsense draws a
distinction between causes and background conditions, ranking the
camper's lighting of the fire among the former, and his birth and his
failure to be struck down by a meteor, among the latter.</p>

<p>

 H. L. A. Hart and A. Honoré (1965; 2nd ed 1985) argue that the
distinction between causes and conditions is relative to context in at
least two different ways. One form of relativity might be called
relativity to the context of occurrence. If a forest is destroyed by
fire, the presence of oxygen would be cited as a mere condition of the
forest's destruction. On the other hand, if a fire breaks out in a
laboratory where oxygen is deliberately excluded, it may be
appropriate to cite the presence of oxygen as a cause of the fire. The
second form of relativity might be called relativity to the context of
enquiry. For example, the cause of a great famine in India may be
identified by an Indian farmer as the drought, but the World Food
Authority may identify the Indian government's failure to build up
reserves as the cause, and the drought as a mere condition.</p>

<p>
 For the most part, Lewis ignores these subtle context-sensitive
distinctions, as he says he is interested in a broad, non-discriminatory notion of
cause. In his view (1986d), every event has an objective causal
history consisting of a vast structure of events ordered by causal
dependence. The human mind may select parts of the causal history for
attention, perhaps different parts for different purposes of
enquiry. However, Lewis does not specify the ‘principles of
invidious selection’ by which some parts of the causal history
are selected for attention, except to mention the relevance of Grice's
maxims of conversation. But Grice's maxims of conversation, as general
principles of rational information exchange, are not well suited to
explaining the causation-specific distinctions we draw. As several
philosophers have pointed out (A. Garfinkel (1981); C. Hitchcock
(1996a, 1996b); P. Lipton (1990); J. Woodward (1984); and B. Van
Fraassen (1981)), some of the contextual principles behind our causal
judgements seem to rely on considerations concerning which class of
situations the effect is contrasted with.</p>

<p>
 Thus, in the example of the Indian famine, we contrast the actual
situation in which a famine occurs with another situation in which
normal conditions prevail and a famine does not occur. A cause is then
thought of as a factor that makes the difference between these
situations; and the background conditions are thought of as those
factors that are common to the two situations. In different contexts
of enquiry, the contrast situation is framed in different terms. A
farmer may take the contrast situation to be the normal situation in
which the government does not stockpile food reserves but there is no
famine. In this case it would be reasonable for the farmer to identify
the drought as the factor that makes the difference between this
contrast situation and the actual situation in which there is
famine. On the other hand, an official of the World Food Authority
with a different conception of what normally happens may take the
contrast situation to be one in which governments build up food
reserves as a precaution against droughts. Consequently, it would be
reasonable for the official to see the failure of the government to
build up food reserves as the factor that makes the difference between
the contrast situation and the actual situation in which there is a
famine. (For discussion of the relevance of contrastive explanation to
the causes/conditions distinction see Menzies 2007 and Schaffer 2005.)</p>

<p>
 A good case can be made that causal statements display
contrast-relativity not only at the effect-end but also at the
cause-end. (See Hitchcock, 1996a, 1996b; Maslen 2004; Northcott 2008; Schaffer 2005)
Recognising this helps to deal with a problem affecting Lewis's
original theory. In evaluating whether an event <em>c</em> caused an
event <em>e</em>, Lewis's theory says we have to consider what would
have happened in those closest worlds in which <em>c</em> did not
occur. For example, in evaluating whether the camper's lighting of the
fire caused the forest, we have to consider what would have happened
in those closest possible worlds in which the camper's action of
lighting the fire did not occur. Are these worlds in which the camper
does not light the fire but does something else instead, or are they
worlds in which he lights the fire in slightly different manner
(perhaps with a lighter instead of matches) or at a slightly different
time (three minutes later when the wind died down)? In order to answer
such questions, Lewis says it is necessary to say how much of a change
or a delay it takes for an event to become an altogether different
event, rather than a different version of the same event. (Lewis
sometimes discusses this issue as the question of how fragile events
are: <i>a modally fragile</i> event is one which cannot occur in a
different manner or at a different time from its actual manner and
time of occurrence. See Lewis 1986b.) The problem, as he sees it, is
that there is no unique principled way in which we do this: there is
linguistic indeterminancy about what event nominals refer to. He
writes: “We have not made up our minds: and if we presuppose sometimes
one answer and sometimes another answer, we are entirely within our
linguistic rights. This is itself a big problem for a counterfactual
analysis of causation, quite apart from the problem of preemption.”
(2000, p.186)</p>

<p>
 However, if we recognise that the cause-end of causal statements
displays contrast-relativity as well as the effect-end, we can obviate
the need to provide an account of the identity of events under
counterfactual changes. For example, suppose we are interested in why
the forest fire took one path <em>P<sub>1</sub></em> rather than
another path <em>P<sub>2</sub></em>. Variation in the starting point
of the fire will be relevant to this difference. So it would be
appropriate to say that the camper's lighting the fire in location
<em>L<sub>1</sub></em> rather another location <em>L<sub>2</sub></em>
caused the forest fire to take path <em>P<sub>1</sub></em> rather than
<em>P<sub>2</sub></em>. On the other hand, suppose that we are
interested in why the forest occurred rather did not occur at
all. Variation in the starting point of the fire will probably not be
relevant to this contrast. Rather the appropriate causal statement
will be one that says the camper's lighting the fire (in some or other
location) rather his not lighting it (in any location) caused the fire
to occur rather than not to occur. Such causal statements reveal the
relevant contrasts at both the cause- and the effect-ends. Sometimes,
such contrasts are indicated by the use of emphasis as in “The fire's
starting in <em>location L<sub>1</sub></em> caused the fire to take
<em>path P<sub>1</sub></em>”. But more often than not the surface form
of causal statements does not disclose the contrasts that are intended
and they must be supplied by context. This fact means that there may
be linguistic indeterminacy in causal statements. But it is not
indeterminacy about the reference of event nominals, but rather about
the situations that are intended as contrasts for the cause and the
effect. Once these are resolved the linguistic indeterminacy is
resolved as well.</p>

<p>
 The contrast-relativity of causal statements, if it is genuine, has
significant implications for the form that a counterfactual analysis
should take. Those who accept the arguments above for the
context-relativity of causal statements think that the canonical form
of causal statements is “<em>c</em> rather than <em>c*</em> caused
<em>e</em> rather than <em>e*</em>”, where the contrast situations
<em>c*</em> and <em>e*</em> are supplied by context. This suggests
that the definition of causal dependence should not be formulated in
terms of the counterfactual “If <em>c</em> had not occurred,
<em>e</em> would not have occurred”, but the more specific
counterfactual “If <em>c*</em> had occurred instead
of <em>c</em>, then <em>e*</em> would have occurred instead
of <em>e</em>”. This formulation has several advantages over the
old formulation. (For discussion of this point see Schaffer 2005. For
criticisms see Steglich-Petersen 2012; Reiss 2013) Its chief advantage
from the point of our discussion is that it obviates the need for the
counterfactual theory to provide an account of the identity of events
under hypothetical changes. With this new formulation, there is no
need to work out whether <em>c*</em> and <em>e*</em> are identical
with, or different from, <em>c</em> and
<em>e</em>,respectively. It is simply stipulated on the basis of
contextual considerations that <em>c*</em> and <em>e*</em> are
intended to act as contrasts to <em>c</em> and <em>e</em>.</p>

<h3><a name="TemAsy">3.2 Temporal Asymmetry</a></h3>

<p>

There have been several important critical discussions of Lewis's
explanation of the temporal asymmetry of causation. (See Elga 2000;
Frisch 2007; Hausman 1998: Chap. 6; Horwich 1987: Chap. 10; Loewer
2007; Kutach 2013: Chaps. 3-7; Price 1996: Chap. 6.; Price and Weslake
2009) </p>

<p>
 One kind of criticism has focused on the psychological implausibility
of Lewis's explanation. (See Horwich 1987.)  Recall that the
explanation appeals, on the one hand, to a system of weighted respects
of similarity between possible worlds that is delivered by <i>a
priori</i> conceptual analysis and, on the other hand, to an asymmetry
of overdetermination that is claimed to be a contingent <i>a
posteriori</i> truth about the actual world. The two-part explanation
is supposed to employ facts that are sufficiently well known to play a
role in the explanation of our linguistic use of
counterfactuals. However, it is psychologically implausible that the
intricate system of weighted respects of similarity involving
comparison of miracles of different sizes could capture the intuitive
similarity relation used in counterfactual reasoning. Why should we
have developed such a baroque notion of similarity? Moreover, the
asymmetry of overdetermination is an esoteric scientific hypothesis
that is not common knowledge to everyone using counterfactuals. So it
is very unlikely that this hypothesis could account for ordinary
speakers' mastery of the temporal asymmetry of counterfactuals. (For
Lewis's reply to this criticism see Postscript E to “Counterfactual
Dependence and Time's Arrow” in his (1986a, p. 66).)</p>

<p>
 Another criticism is that the asymmetry of overdetermination does not
exist in the form required to support Lewis's explanation of the
temporal asymmetry of counterfactuals. Lewis's idea is that any event
<em>e</em> has many postdeterminants and few predeterminants, where a
predeterminant or postdeterminant of an event is a set of conditions
that are jointly sufficient, given the laws of nature, for the
occurrence of the event. But if Lewis is assuming that the laws
involved are like those of classical mechanics, he is mistaken on this
score. For a theory that is time symmetric and deterministic in both
the forward and backward direction will imply that for any local event
<em>e</em> and any time <em>t</em>, there is a unique set of
conditions obtaining at <em>t</em> that are necessary and sufficient,
given the laws, for the occurrence of the event <em>e</em>. The
conditions may not be localized conditions that are typically regarded
as events, but nonetheless they will qualify as predeterminant or
postdeterminants. For example, consider Popper's example of the wave
spreading out from a point source. If there is a process that
postdetermines what happens at the point at which the wave is emitted,
there is also a process, perhaps a very unlocalized process, that
predetermines this. <i>Pace</i> Popper and Lewis, both processes are equally
likely; and whether they occur depends on the boundary conditions of
the system. (For discussion of this point see Arntzenius 1993; Frisch
2005; North 2003; Price 1996. Also see the entry “Thermodynamic
Asymmetry in Time”.)</p>

<p>

A related criticism concerns the asymmetry of miracles that is central
to Lewis's account of the temporal asymmetry of causation. The
asymmetry of miracles consists in the fact that a miracle that
realises a counterfactual antecedent about particular facts at time
<em>t</em> by having a possible world diverge from the actual world
just before the time <em>t</em> is smaller and less diverse than a
miracle that realises the same counterfactual antecedent and makes a
possible world converge to the actual world after the time
<em>t</em>. Adam Elga (2000) has argued that the asymmetry of miracles
does not hold in many cases.</p>

<p>

Elga's argument proceeds by way of an example: Gretta cracks an egg
into a hot frying pan at 8:00am and at 8:05am the egg is
cooked. Consider the process that occurs in the period from 8:00am to
8:05am, run backwards in time: a cooked egg sits in the frypan; it
coalesces into a raw egg and leaps upward; and a shell closes around
it. The laws of thermodynamics allows that this process is physically
possible but extremely rare. These laws also state that the process is
very sensitive in its initial conditions: even the slightest changes
in the molecules making up the state of the cooked egg would result in
the process evolving in such a way that the cooked egg continues to
sit in the pan rather than coalescing into a raw egg and leaping
upwards. But this is, Elga points out, exactly the kind of change that
would make for a “convergence miracle”. Take the state of
the actual world at 8:05am, holding fixed its future after this point;
make some small changes to the molecules making up this state; and
then run the laws of thermodynamics backwards in time, and we will
almost certainly arrive at a state in which the egg sits in the pan
growing colder. This state will be one in which Gretta does not crack
the egg. The small change in the state of the actual world at 8:05am
is a “convergence miracle” that yields a possible world
that realises the counterfactual proposition that Gretta does not
crack the egg at 8:00am while holding fixed the actual future after
8:05am. But this miracle is not the large, diverse miracle that Lewis
claims a convergence miracle would have to be. </p>

<h3><a name="Tra">3.3 Transitivity</a></h3>

<p>

As we have seen, Lewis builds transitivity into causation by defining
it in terms of chains of causal dependence. The transitivity of
causation fits with some of our explanatory practices. For example,
historians wishing to explain some significant historical event will
trace the explanation back through a number of causal links,
concluding that the event at the beginning of the causal chain is
responsible for the event being explained. On the other hand, a number
of counter-examples have been presented which cast doubt on
transitivity. (Lewis 2004a presents a short catalogue of these
counterexamples.) Here is a sample of two counterexamples.</p>

<p>

First, an example due to Ned Hall (2004).&nbsp; A person is walking
along a mountain trail, when a boulder high above is dislodged and
comes careering down the mountain slopes. The walker notices the
boulder and ducks at the appropriate time. The careering boulder
causes the walker to duck and this, in turn, causes his continued
stride. (This second causal link involves <i>double prevention</i>:
the duck prevents the collision between walker and boulder which, had
it occurred, would have prevented the walker's continued stride.)
However, the careering boulder is the sort of thing that would prevent
the walker's continued stride and so it seems counterintuitive to say
that it causes the stride.</p>

<p>

Second, an example due to Douglas Ehring (1987). Jones puts some
potassium salts into a hot fire. Because potassium compounds produce a
purple flame when heated, the flame changes to a purple colour, though
everything else remains the same. The purple flame ignites some
flammable material nearby. Here we judge that putting the potassium
salts in the fire caused the purple flame, which in turn caused the
flammable material to ignite. But it seems implausible to judge that
putting the potassium salts in the fire caused the flammable material
to ignite.</p>

<p> 

Various replies have been made to these counterexamples. The second
counterexample seems the most easily deflected. For example, Maslen
(2004), who endorses the contrast-relativity of causal statements, has
argued that this example is misdiagnosed as a counterexample to
transitivity, as the contrast situation at the effect-end of the first
causal statement does not match up with the contrast situation at the
cause-end of the second causal statement. Thus, the first causal
statement should be interpreted as saying that Jones's putting
potassium salts in the fire rather not doing so caused the flame to
<i> turn purple rather than yellow</i>; but the second causal
statement should be interpreted as saying that <i>the purple fire's
occurring rather than not occurring</i> caused the flammable material
to ignite rather not to ignite. Where there is a mismatch of this
kind, we do not have a genuine counterexample to transitivity. L. Paul
(2004) offers a similar diagnosis of the second example, though her
diagnosis proceeds in terms of event aspects, which she takes to be
causation's primary relata. She argues similarly that there is mismatch
between the event aspect that is the effect of the first causal link
(the flame's being a purple colour) and the event aspect that is the
cause of the second causal link (the flame's touching the flammable
material).</p>

<p> 

The first example cannot be handled in the same way. Some defenders of
transitivity have replied that our intuitions about the intransitivity
of causation in these examples are misleading. For instance, Lewis
(2004a) points out that the counterexamples to transitivity typically
involve a structure in which a <em>c</em>-type event generally
prevents an <em>e</em>-type but in the particular case
the <em>c</em>-event actually causes another event that counters the
threat and causes the
<em>e</em>-event. If we mix up questions of what is generally
conducive to what, with questions about what caused what in this
particular case, he says, we may think that it is reasonable to deny
that <em>c</em> causes <em>e</em>. But if we keep the focus sharply on
the particular case, we must insist that <em>c</em> does in fact cause
<em>e</em>.</p>

<p>

The debate about the transitivity of causation is not easily settled,
partly because it is tied up with the issue of how it is best for a
counterfactual theory to deal with examples of preemption. As we have
seen, Lewis's counterfactual theory relies on the transitivity of
causation to handle cases of preemption. If such cases could be
handled in some other way, that would take some of the theoretical
pressure off the theory, allowing it concede the persuasive
counterexamples to transitivity without succumbing to the difficulties
posed by preemption. (For more on this point see Hitchcock 2001. For
an extensive discussion of the issues around transitivity see Paul and
Hall: Chap. 5.)</p>

<h3><a name="Pre">3.4 Preemption</a></h3>

<p>

As we have seen, Lewis employs his strategy of defining causation in
terms of chains of causal dependence not only to make causation
transitive, but also to deal with preemption examples. However, there
are preemption examples that this strategy cannot deal with
satisfactorily. Difficulties concerning preemption have proven to be
the biggest bugbear for Lewis's theory.(Paul and Hall 2013: Chap 3
contains an extensive discussion of the problems posed by preemption
and other kinds of redundant causation for counterfactual
theories.) </p>

<p>
 In his (1986c), Lewis distinguishes cases of <i>early</i> and
<i>late preemption</i>. In early preemption examples, the process
running from the preempted alternative is cut short before the main
process running from the preempting cause has gone to completion. The
example of the two assassins, given above, is an example of this
sort. The theory of causation in terms of chains of causal dependence
can handle this sort of example. In contrast, cases of late
preemption are ones in which the process running from the preempted
cause is cut short only after the main process has gone to completion
and brought about the effect. The following is an example of late
preemption due to Hall (2004).</p>

<p>
 Billy and Suzy throw rocks at a bottle. Suzy throws first so that
her rock arrives first and shatters the glass. Without Suzy's
throw, Billy's throw would have shattered the bottle. However,
Suzy's throw is the actual cause of the shattered bottle, while
Billy's throw is merely a preempted potential cause. This is a
case of late preemption because the alternative process (Billy's
throw) is cut short after the main process (Suzy's throw) has
actually brought about the effect.</p>

<p>
 Lewis's theory cannot explain the judgement that Suzy's
throw was the actual cause of the shattering of the bottle. For there
is no causal dependence between Suzy's throw and the shattering,
since even if Suzy had not thrown her rock, the bottle would have
shattered due to Billy's throw. Nor is there a chain of stepwise
dependences running cause to effect, because there is no event
intermediate between Suzy's throw and the shattering that links
them up into a chain of dependences. Take, for instance, Suzy's
rock in mid-trajectory.&nbsp; Certainly, this event depends on
Suzy's initial throw, but the problem is that the shattering of
the bottle does not depend on it, because even without it the bottle
would still have shattered because of Billy's throw.</p>

<p>
 To be sure, the bottle shattering that would have occurred without
Suzy's throw would be different from the bottle shattering that
actually occurred with Suzy's throw. For a start, it would have
occurred later. This observation suggests that one solution to the
problem of late preemption might be to insist that the events involved
should be construed as fragile events. Accordingly, it will be true
rather than false that if Suzy had not thrown her rock, then the
actual bottle shattering, taken as a fragile event with an essential
time and manner of occurrence, would not have occurred. Lewis himself
does not endorse this response on the grounds that a uniform policy of
construing events as fragile would go against our usual practices, and
would generate many spurious causal dependences. For example, suppose
that a poison kills its victim more slowly and painfully when taken on
a full stomach. Then, the victim's eating dinner before he drinks the
poison would count as a cause of his death since the time and manner
of the death depend on the eating of the dinner. (For discussion of
the limitations of this response see Lewis 1986c, 2000.)</p>

<p>
 When we turn from preemption examples involving deterministic
causation to those involving chancy causation, we see that the
problems for Lewis's theory multiply. One particularly recalcitrant
problem is described in Menzies 1989. (See also Woodward 1990.)
Suppose that two systems can produce the same effect, perhaps at the
same time and in the same manner. (It does not matter whether this is
an example of early or late preemption.)  However, one system is much
more reliable than the other. The reliable system starts and, left to
itself, will very probably produce the effect. But you do not leave it
to itself. You throw a switch that shuts down the reliable system and
turns on the unreliable one. As luck would have it, the unreliable
system works and brings about the effect. This kind of example
presents a problem for the probabilistic generalisation of the
counterfactual theory because the preempting actual cause decreases
the chance of the effect while the preempted potential cause increases
its chance. In addition to the problem of explaining how the
preempting cause qualifies as a cause when the effect does not
causally depend on it, the probabilistic counterfactual theory faces
the problem of explaining how the preempted cause is not really a
cause when the effect does causally depend on it.(Examples of this
kind have been the subject of extensive discussion in the context of
both counterfactual and probabilistic theories of causation. For
discussions about how best to deal with them within theories admitting
of indeterminism, see Barker 2004; Beebee 2004; Dowe 2000, 2004;
Hitchcock 2004; Kvart 2004; Noordhof 1999, 2004; Ramachandran 1997,
2004.)</p>

<h2><a name="LatDev">4. Later Developments</a></h2>

<p>

In this section we shall consider some recent developments of the
counterfactual approach to causation, which have been motivated by the
desire to overcome the deficiencies in Lewis's 1973 theory, especially
with respect to preemption.</p>

<ul>
<li>4.1 Lewis's 2000 Theory</li>
<li>4.2 Causation as Intrinsic Relation</li>
<li>4.3 The Structural Equations Framework</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Lew200The">4.1 Lewis's 2000 Theory</a></h3>

<p>

In an attempt to deal with the various problems facing his 1973
theory, Lewis developed a new version of the counterfactual theory,
which he first presented in his Whitehead Lectures at Harvard
University in March 1999. (A shortened version of the lectures
appeared as his (2000). The full lectures are published as his
(2004a).)</p>

<p>
 Counterfactuals play a central role in the new theory, as in the
old. But the counterfactuals it employs do not simply state
dependences of <i>whether</i> one event occurs on <i>whether</i>
another event occurs. The counterfactuals state dependences of
<i>whether</i>, <i>when</i>, and <i>how</i> one event occurs on
<i>whether</i>, <i>when</i>, and <i>how</i> another event occurs. A
key idea in the formulation of these counterfactuals is that of an
<i>alteration</i> of an event. This is an actualised or unactualised
event that occurs at a slightly different time or in a slightly
different manner from the given event. An alteration is, by
definition, a very fragile event that could not occur at a different
time, or in a different manner without being a different event. Lewis
intends the terminology to be neutral on the issue of whether an
alteration of an event is a version of the same event or a numerically
different event.</p>

<p>
 The central notion of the new theory is that of influence.</p>

<blockquote>

<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top">(7)</td>
<td>Where <em>c</em> and <em>e</em> are distinct events, <em>c</em>
<i>influences</i> <em>e</em> if and only if there is a substantial
range of <em>c</em>1, <em>c</em>2, … of different not-too-distant
alterations of <em>c</em> (including the actual alteration of
<em>c</em>) and there is a range of <em>e</em>1, <em>e</em>2, … of
alterations of <em>e</em>, at least some of which differ, such that
if <em>c</em>1 had occurred, <em>e</em>1 would have occurred, and if
<em>c</em>2 had occurred, e2 would have occurred, and so on.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>

 Where one event influences another, there is a pattern of
counterfactual dependence of whether, when, and how upon whether,
when, and how. As before, causation is defined as an ancestral
relation.</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top">(8)</td>
 <td><em>c</em> <i>causes</i> <em>e</em> if and only if there is a
chain of stepwise influence from <em>c</em> to <em>e</em>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 One of the points Lewis advances in favour of this new theory is
that it handles cases of late as well as early pre-emption. (The
theory is restricted to deterministic causation and so does not
address the example of probabilistic preemption described in section
3.4.) Reconsider, for instance, the example of late preemption
involving Billy and Suzy throwing rocks at a bottle. The theory is
supposed to explain why Suzy's throw, and not Billy's
throw, is the cause of the shattering of the bottle. If we take an
alteration in which Suzy's throw is slightly
different (the rock is lighter, or she throws
sooner), while holding fixed Billy's throw, we find that
the shattering is different too. But if we make similar alterations
to Billy's throw while holding Suzy's throw fixed, we find
that the shattering is unchanged.</p>

<p>
Another point in favour of the new theory is that it handles a type of
preemption Lewis that have come to be called
<i>trumping</i>. (Trumping was first described by Jonathan
Schaffer(2000).) Lewis gives an example involving a major and a
sergeant who are shouting orders at the soldiers. The major and
sergeant simultaneously shout “Advance”; the soldiers hear
them both and advance. Since the soldiers obey the superior officer,
they advance because the major orders them to, not because the
sergeant does. So the major's command preempts or trumps the
sergeant's. Where other theories have difficulty with trumping cases,
Lewis's argues his new theory handles them with ease. Altering the
major's command while holding fixed the sergeant's, the soldier's
response would be correspondingly altered. In contrast, altering the
sergeant's command, while holding fixed the major's, would make no
difference at all.</p>

<p>
 There is, however, some reason for scepticism about whether the new
theory handles the examples of late preemption and trumping
completely satisfactorily. In the example of late preemption,
Billy's throw has some degree of influence on the shattering of
the bottle. For if Billy had thrown his rock earlier (so that it
preceded Suzy's throw) and in a different manner, the bottle
would have shattered earlier and in a different manner. Likewise, the
sergeant's command has some degree of influence on the
soldiers' advance in that if the sergeant had shouted earlier
than the major with a different command, the soldiers would have
obeyed his order. In response to these points, Lewis must say that
these alterations of the events are too-distant to be considered
relevant. But some metric of distance in alterations is required,
since it seems that similar alterations of Suzy's throw and the
major's command are relevant to their having causal influence.</p>

<p> 
 It has also been argued that the new theory generates a great number of
spurious instances of causation. (For discussion see Collins
2000; Kvart 2001.) The theory implies that
any event that influences another event to a certain degree counts as
one of its causes. But common sense is more discriminating about
causes. To take an example of Jonathan Bennett (1987): rain in
December delays a forest fire; if there had been no December rain,
the forest would have caught fire in January rather than when it actually
did in February. The rain influences the fire with respect to its
timing, location, rapidity, and so forth. But common sense denies
that the rain was a cause of <i>the fire</i>, though it allows that
it is a cause of the <i>delay in the fire</i>. Similarly, in the
example of the poison victim discussed above, the victim's
ingesting poison on a full stomach influences the time and manner of
his death (making it a slow and painful death), but common sense
refuses to countenance his eating dinner as a cause of <i>his death</i>,
though it may countenance it as a cause of <i>its being a slow and
painful death</i>. <i>Pace</i> Lewis, common sense does not take anything
that affects the time and manner of an event to be a cause of the
event <i>simpliciter</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="CauIntRel">4.2 Causation as Intrinsic Relation</a></h3>

<p>

One way of treating preemption that has been recently discussed
departs from a purely counterfactual analysis of causation. It has
been argued that preemption examples highlight the intuitive idea
that causation is an intrinsic relation between events, which is to
say it is a local relation depending on the intrinsic properties of
the events and what goes on between them, and nothing else. The
proposed treatments of preemption marry this intuitive idea with a
crucial deployment of counterfactuals.</p>

<p>
 At one time Lewis himself resorted to this way of treating late
preemption examples when he invoked the notion of
<i>quasi-dependence</i>. (See his (1986c).) To explain this notion
consider a case that resembles the case of Billy and Suzy throwing
rocks at a bottle. Suzy throws a rock and shatters the bottle in
exactly the same way in which she does in the original case. But in
this case Billy and his rock are entirely absent. Lewis argued that
since the process in the original case and the process in the
comparison case are intrinsically alike (and also obey the same
laws), both or neither must be causal. However, the comparison
process is surely a causal process since, thanks to Billy's
absence, it exhibits a causal dependence. Accordingly, the process in
the original case must be a causal process too, even though it does
not exhibit a causal dependence. In such examples Lewis has said that the
actual process that does not exhibit causal dependence is,
nonetheless, causal by courtesy: it exhibits <i>quasi-dependence</i>
in virtue of its intrinsic resemblance to the causal process in the
comparison case.</p>

<p>
 A related idea is pursued in Menzies (1996; 1999). Menzies argues
that there is an element in our concept of causation that resists
capture in purely counterfactual terms. This element consists in the
idea that causation is a structural relation that underlies and
supports causal dependences. This idea can be captured by treating
the concept of causation as the concept of a theoretical
entity. Applying a standard treatment of theoretical concepts, he
argues that causation should be defined as the unique occupant of a
certain characteristic role given by the platitudes of the folk
theory of causation. One platitude is that causation is an intrinsic
relation between events. Another platitude is that it is <i>typically</i>,
but not invariably, accompanied by causal dependence. Accordingly,
causation is defined in the following way:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top">(9)</td>
 <td><em>c</em> causes <em>e</em> if only if the intrinsic relation
that typically accompanies causal dependence holds between <em>c</em>
and <em>e</em>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 On this account, causation is not constituted by causal
dependence. It is, in fact, a distinct relation for which causal
dependence is, at best, a defeasible marker. The relation may be
identified <i>a posteriori</i> with some physically specifiable
relation such as energy-momentum transfer. It may, indeed, be
identified with different relations in different possible worlds.</p>

<p>
 This definition is supposed to explain common sense intuitions about
preemption examples. For example, Suzy's throw, and not
Billy's throw, caused the shattering of the bottle, because the
intrinsic relation that typically accompanies causal dependence
connects Suzy's throw, but not Billy's throw, with the
shattering of the bottle.</p>

<p>
 Lewis later rejected the approach to preemption via quasi-dependence
in favour of his 2000 theory in terms of influence. In Lewis 2004a and
2004b, he claims that theories of causation as an intrinsic relation
do not do justice to the full range of our intuitions about
causation. (For related points see Hall 2002, 2004.) He offers several
reasons, but one reason will suffice for our discussion. The intuition
that causation is an intrinsic matter does not apply to cases of
double prevention. Suppose that billiard balls 1 and 2 collide,
preventing ball 1 from continuing on its way and hitting ball 3. If
the collision of balls 1 and 3 had occurred, ball 3 would not have
later collided with ball 4. So, we have double prevention: the
collision of balls 1 and 2 prevented the collision of balls 1 and 3,
which would have prevented the later collision of balls 3 and 4. Here
it seems reasonable to say that the collision of balls 1 and 2 was a
cause of the later collision of balls 3 and 4. Lewis observes that the
causation in such cases of double prevention is partly an extrinsic
matter. If there had been some other obstruction that would have
stopped ball 1 from hitting ball 3, the collision of 3 and 4 would not
have depended on the collision of 1 and 2. Moreover, he notes that
much of the spatiotemporal region between the collision of balls 1 and
2 and the collision of balls 3 and 4 is simply empty so that there is
no chain of events to serve as a connecting process between cause and
effect. The intuition that causation is an intrinsic relation does not
apply in this case. More generally, he argues that theories of
causation as an intrinsic relation are overhasty generalisations of
one specific kind of causation, and they fail to do justice to our
intuitions about causation involving absences (as causes, effects or
intermediaries).</p>

<h3><a name="StrEquFra">4.3 The Structural Equations Framework</a></h3>

<p>
 A number of contemporary philosophers (Hitchcock 2001, 2007; Woodward
2003; Woodward and Hitchcock 2003) have explored an alternative
counterfactual approach to causation that employs the structural
equations framework. This framework, which has been used in the social
sciences and biomedical sciences since the 1930s and 1940s, received
its state-of-the-art formulation in Judea Pearl's landmark 2000
book. Hitchcock and Woodward acknowledge their debt to Pearl's work
and to the related work on causal Bayes nets by Peter Spirtes, Clark
Glymour, and Richard Scheines (1993). However, while Pearl and
Spirtes, Glymour and Scheines focus on issues to do with causal
discovery and inference, Woodward and Hitchcock focus on issues of the
meaning of causal claims. For this reason, their formulations of the
structural equations framework are better suited to the purposes of this
discussion. The exposition of this section follows that of Hitchcock
2001, in particular. While philosophical work using this framework has
only just begun, it would seem that this framework looks likely to
rival Lewis's framework in terms of its theoretical richness and
fruitfulness.</p>

<p>
  The structural equations framework describes the causal structure of
a system in terms of a causal model of the system, which is identified
as an ordered pair &lt;<i>V</i>, <i>E</i>&gt;, where <i>V</i> is a set of
variables and <i>E</i> a set of structural equations stating
deterministic relations among the variables. (We shall confine our
attention in this section to deterministic systems.) The variables in
<i>V</i> describe the different possible states of the system in
question. While they can take any number of values, in the simple
examples to be considered here the variables are typically binary
variables that take the value 1 if some event occurs and the value 0
if the event does not occur. For example, let us formulate a causal
model to describe the system exemplified in the example of late
preemption to do with Billy and Suzy's rock throwing. We might
describe the system using the following set of variables:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>BT</i> = 1 if Billy throws a rock, 0 otherwise;</li>
<li><i>ST</i> = 1 if Suzy throws a rock, 0 otherwise;</li>
<li><i>BH</i> = 1 if Billy's rock hits the bottle, 0 otherwise;</li>
<li><i>SH</i> = 1 if Suzy's rock hits the bottle, 0 otherwise;</li>
<li><i>BS</i> = 1 if the bottle shatters, 0 otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<p>
 Here the variables are binary. But a different model might have used
many-valued variables to represent the different ways in which Billy
and Suzy threw their rocks, their rocks hit the bottle, or the bottle
shattered.</p>

<p>
 The structural equations in a model describe the dynamical evolution
of the system being modelled. There is a structural equation for each
variable. The form taken by a structural equation for a variable
depends on which kind of variable it is. The structural equation for
an <i>exogenous variable</i> (the values of which are determined by
factors outside of the model) takes the form of <i>Y</i> = <i>y</i>,
which simply states the actual value of the variable. The structural
equation for an <i>endogenous variable</i> (the values of which are
determined by factors within the model) states how the value of the
variable is determined by the values of the other variables. It takes
the form:</p>

<blockquote>

<i>Y</i> = <i>f(X<sub>1</sub>,…, X<sub>n</sub>)</i>

</blockquote>

<p>
What does this structural equation mean?  There are in fact competing
interpretations. Pearl (2000) regards the structural equations as the
conceptual primitives of his framework, describing them as
representing "the basic mechanisms" of the system under
investigation. However, for the purposes of exposition, it is more
convenient to follow the interpretation of Woodward (2003) and
Hitchcock (2001), who think of the structural equations as expressing
certain basic counterfactuals of the following form:</p>

<blockquote>
 If it were the case that <i>X<sub>1</sub></i> = <i>x<sub>1</sub></i>,
<i>X<sub>2</sub></i> = <i>x<sub>2</sub></i>,…, <i>X<sub>n</sub></i>
= <i>x<sub>n</sub></i>, then it would be the case that <i>Y</i> =
<i>f(x<sub>1</sub>,…,x<sub>n</sub>)</i>.</blockquote>

<p>

As this form of counterfactual suggests, the structural equations are
to be read from right to left: the antecedent of the counterfactual
states possible values of the variables <i>X<sub>1</sub></i> through
to <i>X<sub>n</sub></i> and the consequent states the corresponding
value of the endogenous variable <i>Y</i>.  There is a counterfactual
of this kind for every combination of possible values of the variables
<i>X<sub>1</sub></i> through to <i>X<sub>n</sub></i>. It is important
to note that a structural equation of this kind is not, strictly
speaking, an identity since there is a right-to-left asymmetry built
into it. This asymmetry corresponds to the asymmetry of
non-backtracking counterfactuals. For example, supposing that the
actual situation is one in which neither Suzy nor Billy throws a rock
so the bottle does not shatter, the non-backtracking counterfactual
“If either Suzy or Billy had thrown a rock, the bottle would
have shattered” is true. But the counterfactual “If the
bottle had shattered, either Suzy or Billy would have thrown a
rock” is false. </p>

<p>
 As an illustration, consider the set of structural equations that
might be used to model the late preemption example of Billy and
Suzy. Given the variables listed above, the structural equations might
be stated as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>ST</i> = 1;</li>
<li><i>BT</i> = 1;</li>
<li><i>SH</i> = <i>ST</i>;</li>
<li><i>BH</i> = <i>BT</i> &amp; <i>~SH</i>;</li>
<li><i>BS</i> = <i>SH</i> v <i>BT</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
 In these equations logical symbols are used to represent mathematical
functions on binary variables: <i>~X</i> = 1 − <i>X</i>;
<i>X</i> v <i>Y</i> = max{<i>X</i>, <i>Y</i>}; <i>X</i> &amp; <i>Y</i> =
min{<i>X</i>, <i>Y</i>}. The first two equations simply state the
actual values of the exogenous variables <i>ST</i> and <i>BT</i>. The
third equation encodes two counterfactuals, one for each possible
value of <i>ST</i>. It states that if Suzy threw a rock, her rock hit
the bottle; and if she didn't throw a rock, her rock didn't hit the
bottle. The fourth equation encodes four counterfactuals, one for each
possible combination of values for <i>BT</i> and <i>~SH</i>. It states
that if Billy threw a rock and Suzy's rock didn't hit the bottle,
Billy's rock hit the bottle; but didn't do so if one or more of these
conditions was not met. The fifth equation encodes four
counterfactuals, one for each possible combination of values for
<i>SH</i> and <i>BH</i>. It states that if one or other (or possibly
both) of Suzy's rock or Billy's rock hit the bottle, the bottle
shattered; but if neither rock hit the bottle, the bottle didn't
shatter.</p>

<p>
 The structural equations above can be represented in terms of <i>a
directed graph</i>. The variables in the set <i>V</i> are represented
as nodes in the graph.  An arrow directed from one node <i>X</i> to
another <i>Y</i> represents the fact that the variable <i>X</i>
appears on the right-hand side of the structural equation for
<i>Y</i>. In this case, <i>X</i> is said to be <i>a parent</i> of
<i>Y</i>. Exogenous variables are represented by nodes that have no
arrows directed towards them. A <i>directed path</i> from <i>X</i> to
<i>Y</i> in a graph is a sequence of arrows that connect <i>X</i> with
<i>Y</i>. The directed graph of the model described above of Billy and
Suzy example is depicted in Figure 1 below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <img src="./Counterfactual Theories of Causation (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)_files/figure1.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="300"> <br>
  <strong>Figure 1</strong>
</blockquote>

<p>
 The arrows in this figure tell us that the bottle's shattering is a
function of Suzy's rock hitting the bottle and Billy's rock hitting
the bottle; that Billy's rock hitting the bottle is a function of
Billy's throwing a rock and Suzy's rock hitting the bottle; and that
Suzy's rock hitting the bottle is a function of her throwing the
rock. </p>

<p>
 As we have seen, the structural equations directly encode some
counterfactuals. However, some counterfactuals that are not directly
encoded can be derived from them. Consider, for example, the
counterfactual “If Suzy's rock had not hit the bottle, it would still
have shattered”. As a matter of fact, Suzy's rock did hit the
bottle. But we can determine what would have happened if it hadn't
done so, by replacing the structural equation for the endogenous
variable <i>SH</i> with the equation <i>SH</i> = 0, keeping all the
other equations unchanged. So, instead of having its value determined
in the ordinary way by the variable <i>ST</i>, the value of <i>SH</i>
is set “miraculously”. Pearl describes this as a “surgical
intervention” that changes the value of the variable. In terms of its
graphical representation,this amounts to wiping out the arrow from the
variable <i>ST</i> to the variable <i>SH</i> and treating <i>SH</i> as
if it were an exogenous variable. After this operation, the value of
the variable <i>BS</i> can be computed and shown to be equal to 1:
given that Billy had thrown his rock, his rock would have hit the
bottle and shattered it. So this particular counterfactual is
true. This procedure for evaluating counterfactuals has direct
affinities with Lewis's non-backtracking interpretation of
counterfactuals: the surgical intervention that sets the variable
<i>SH</i> at its hypothetical value but keeps all other equations
unchanged is similar in its effects to Lewis's small miracle that
realises the counterfactual antecedent but preserves the past.</p>

<p>
 In general, to evaluate a counterfactual, say “If it were the case
that <i>X<sub>1</sub>,…,X<sub>n</sub></i>, then …”, one replaces
the original equation for each variable <i>X<sub>i</sub></i> with a
new equation stipulating its hypothetical value,while keeping the
other equations unchanged; then one computes the values for the
remaining variables to see whether they make the consequent true. This
technique of replacing an equation with a hypothetical value set by a
“surgical intervention” enables us to capture the notion of
counterfactual dependence between variables:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top">(10)</td>
<td>A variable <i>Y</i> <i>counterfactually depends</i> on a
variable <i>X</i> in a model if and only if it is actually the case
that <i>X</i> = <i>x</i> and <i>Y</i> = <i>y</i> and there exist
values <i>x</i>′ ≠ <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>′ ≠ <i>y</i> such that
replacing the equation for <i>X</i> with <i>X</i> = <i>x</i>′
yields <i>Y</i> = <i>y</i>′.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 How does the structural equations framework deal with examples of
late pre-emption that pose such problems for Lewis's counterfactual
theory? Can this framework deliver the intuitively correct verdicts in
the example about Suzy and Billy? Halpern and Pearl (2001,2005),
Hitchcock (2001),and Woodward (2003a) all give roughly the same
treatment of examples of late preemption. The key to their treatment
is the employment of a certain procedure for testing the existence of
a causal relation. The procedure is to look for an intrinsic process
connecting the putative cause and effect; suppress the influence of
their non-intrinsic surroundings by “freezing” those
surroundings as they actually are; and then subject the putative cause
to a counterfactual test.  So, for example, to test whether the
variable Suzy's throwing a rock caused the bottle to shatter, we
should examine the process running from <i>ST</i> through
<i>SH</i> to <i>BS</i>; hold fix at its actual value the variable
<i>BH</i> which is extrinsic to this process; and then wiggle the
variable <i>ST</i> to see if it changes the value of <i>BS</i>. The
last steps involve evaluating the counterfactual “If Suzy hadn't
thrown a rock and Billy's rock hadn't hit the bottle, the bottle would
not have shattered”. It is easy to see that this counterfactual
is true. In contrast, when we carry out a similar procedure to test
whether Billy's throwing a rock caused the bottle to shatter,we are
required to consider the counterfactual “If Billy hadn't thrown
his rock and Suzy's rock had hit the bottle, the bottle would not
shattered”. This counterfactual is false. It is the difference
in the truth-value of these two counterfactuals that explains the fact
that it was Suzy's rock throwing, and not Billy's, that caused the
bottle to shatter. (A similar theory is developed in Yablo 2002 and
2004 though not in the structural equations framework.)</p>

<p> 
 Hitchcock (2001) presents a useful regimentation of this
reasoning. He defines <i>a route</i> between two variables <i>X</i>
and <i>Z</i> in the set <i>V</i> to be an ordered sequence of
variables &lt;<i>X</i>, <i>Y<sub>1</sub></i>,…,
<i>Y<sub>n</sub></i>, <i>Z</i>&gt; such each variable in the sequence
is in <i>V</i> and is a parent of its successor in the sequence. A
variable <i>Y</i> is <i>intermediate</i> between <i>X</i> and <i>Z</i>
if and only if it belongs to some route between <i>X</i> and
<i>Z</i>. Then he introduces the new concept of an active causal
route:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top">(11)</td>

<td>The route &lt;<i>X</i>, <i>Y<sub>1</sub></i>,…,
<i>Y<sub>n</sub></i>, <i>Z</i>&gt; is <i>active</i> in the causal model
&lt;<i>V</i>, <i>E</i>&gt; if and only if <i>Z</i> depends counterfactually
on <i>X</i> within the new system of equations <i>E'</i> constructed
from <i>E</i> as follows: for all <i>Y</i> in <i>V</i>, if <i>Y</i> is
intermediate between <i>X</i> and <i>Z</i> but does not belong to the
route &lt;<i>X</i>, <i>Y<sub>1</sub></i>,…, <i>Y<sub>n</sub></i>,
<i>Z</i>&gt;, then replace the equation for <i>Y</i> with a new equation
that sets <i>Y</i> equal to its actual value in <i>E</i>. (If there
are no intermediate variables that do not belong to this route, then
<i>E'</i> is just <i>E</i>.)  </td>

</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 This definition generalises the informal idea sketched in the example
of Suzy and Billy. There is an active causal route going from Suzy's
throwing her rock through her rock hitting the bottle to the bottle
shattering: when we hold fixed Billy's rock not hitting the bottle,
which is the actual value of the only intermediate variable <i>BH</i>
that is not on this route, we see that the bottle's shattering
counterfactually depends on Suzy's throwing her rock. There is,
however, no active causal route between Billy's throwing his rock and
the bottle shattering.</p>

<p>
 In terms of the notion of an active causal route, Hitchcock defines
actual or token causation in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td valign="top">(12)</td>
<td>If <i>c</i> and <i>e</i> are distinct actual events and <i>X</i>
and <i>Z</i> are binary variables whose values represent the
occurrence and non-occurrence of these events, then <i>c</i> is <i>a
cause</i> of <i>e</i> if and only if there is an active causal route
from <i>X</i> to <i>Z</i> in an appropriate causal model
&lt;<i>V</i>, <i>E</i>&gt;.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>

<p>
 A crucial notion in this definition is that of “an appropriate”
model. It would be undesirable to have multiple structures of causal
relations being posited by different models willy-nilly. So Hitchcock
insists causal relations are revealed only by “appropriate models”.
He mentions a number of criteria for appraising whether a model is
appropriate, the most important one being that the structural
equations posited by the model must not imply any false
counterfactual. In order to deal with examples of symmetric
overdetermination, Hitchcock (2001) defines a notion of <i>a weakly
active route</i>, the essential idea being that there is a weakly
active route between <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> just when <i>Y</i>
counterfactually depends on <i>X</i> under the freezing of some
possible, not necessarily actual, values of the variables that are not
on the route from <i>X</i> to <i>Y</i>. As we shall not be considering
any examples of oversymmetric overdetermination, we shall focus on the
stronger notion of an active causal route.</p>

<p>
 This account of causation differs from Lewis's accounts in a number
of respects. One difference is that the account does not appeal to the
transitivity of causation to deal with preemption examples, in
contrast to Lewis's accounts, both early and late. Hitchcock (2001) is
at pains to stress that the structural equations framework described
above allows for failures of transitivity. Another difference between
the accounts is that the structural equations account appeals to
special counterfactuals with complex antecedents in order to handle
preemption examples. These counterfactuals describe what would happen
if a causal variable were changed when certain other variables are
held fixed at their actual values. (Hitchcock calls these “explicitly
nonforetracking counterfactuals”.) Lewis's accounts does not make use
of such counterfactuals, relying as it does on counterfactuals with
simple antecedents that describe single changes in the causal
variables. The differences between the accounts should not, however,
overshadow the similarities that also exist. Both accounts make
central use of non-backtracking counterfactuals and they interpret
these counterfactuals in roughly the same fashion. Setting aside
complications to do with backwards causation, Lewis's account and the
structural equations account have us evaluate a non-backtracking
counterfactual in much the same way: we are to hold fixed the past
history of the system, imagine that the antecedent is realised
“miraculously” by a surgical intervention from outside the system, and
then consider how the new state of the system would evolve in
conformity with the structural equations or laws of the system without
any further interventions.</p>

<p>
 How plausible is this new counterfactual approach to causation? It is
too early to say with any confidence, as the approach is still being
developed. Nonetheless, some early problems have emerged. (See Hall
2007; Halpern and Pearl 2005; Halpern and Hitchcock forthcoming;
Hitchcock 2007; Menzies 2004b; Weslake forthcoming.) Consider, for
instance, the following example, which is a variant of one described
by Hitchcock (2007). An assassin puts poison in the king's coffee. The
bodyguard responds by pouring an antidote in the king's coffee. If the
bodyguard had not poured the antidote in the coffee, the king would
have died. On the other hand, the antidote is fatal when taken by
itself; and if the poison had not been poured in first, it would have
killed the king. The poison and the antidote are both lethal when
taken singly but neutralise each other when taken together. In fact,
the king drinks the coffee and survives.</p>

<p>Suppose we model this scenario using the following variables:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>A</i> = 1 if the assassin pours poison into the king's coffee,
0 otherwise;</li>
<li><i>G</i> = 1 if the bodyguard responds by pouring antidote into
the coffee, 0 otherwise;</li>
<li><i>S</i> = 1 if the king survives, 0 otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<p>And also suppose that we employ these structural equations:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>A</i> = 1;</li>
<li><i>G</i> = <i>A</i>;</li>
<li><i>S</i> = (<i>A</i> &amp; <i>G</i>) v (<i>~A</i> &amp; <i>~G</i>).</li>
</ul>

<p>

The directed graph for this model is depicted in Figure 2.</p>

<blockquote>
  <img src="./Counterfactual Theories of Causation (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)_files/figure2.jpg" alt="Figure 2" width="225"> <br>
  <strong>Figure 2</strong>
</blockquote>

<p> 
 Testing for active causal processes, we can see that the process that
goes directly from the assassin's pouring the poison in the coffee to
the king's survival is active. Holding fixed the fact that the
bodyguard poured the lethal antidote into the coffee, we note that the
king would not have survived if the assassin had not put the poison in
the coffee first. So the theory licenses the verdict that the
assassin's pouring in the poison caused the king to survive. However,
many regard this as a mistaken causal verdict: putting poison in the
king's coffee is exactly the kind of thing that is likely to kill the
king. It might be argued that the causal verdict is justified in view
of the fact that the assassin's action caused the bodyguard's action,
which in turn caused the king's survival. But this appeal to the
transitivity of causation is not open to the defenders of this theory,
who deny the validity of transitivity.</p>

<p> One counterexample by itself is not enough to disprove the whole
structural equations framework. Strictly speaking, it only casts doubt
on the theory of causation that defines causation in terms of the
presence of an active causal route. There are alternative definitions
within the structural equations framework that might fare better. (See
Halpern and Pearl 2005; Weslake forthcoming.) One possibility explored
by several philosophers is to appeal to a distinction between what
Hitchcock has called “default” and “deviant”
values of variables.(See Hitchcock 2007.)  The default value of some
variable represents a normal or to-be-expected state of the system,
whereas a deviant value represents an abnormal or unusual state of the
system. The correlative notion of the default course of evolution for
a system can be characterised as a temporally-ordered sequence of
values that the variables in a model take when the default values of
the exogenous variables are plugged into the structural equations of
the model. Thus, if we set the value of the exogenous
variable <i>A</i> in the example above at its default value 0 instead
of its actual value 1, we can see that the scenario described above
will evolve in the following way: the assassin doesn't put the poison
in the coffee, the bodyguard doesn't put the antidote into the coffee,
and the king survives. Now if we evaluate counterfactual dependences
with counterfactuals centred on the default course of evolution rather
than the actual course of evolution, we can see that the bodyguard's
action counterfactually depends on the assassin's action and the
king's survival depends on the bodyguard's action, but the king's
survival doesn't depend on the assassin's action. If counterfactual
dependences centred on the default course of evolution are taken to
indicate causal relations, these counterfactual dependences more
accurately reflect our intuitive causal judgements. (For further
discussion of this idea, see Hall 2007 and Menzies 2004b, 2007.) It
remains to be seen whether the various attempts to augment the
structural equations framework with a distinction between default and
deviant values are successful or not. (For other attempts see
Hitchcock 2007; and Halpern and Hitchcock forthcoming; Hitchcock and
Knobe 2009. For a critical discussion of these attempts see Schaffer
2013. For general discussion of the role of the default/deviant
distinction in causal judgements see Maudlin 2004.)</p>
